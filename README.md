what is?

Wordle is a popular puzzle game that challenges players to guess a secret five-letter word within six attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback, indicating which letters in the guess are in the correct position (green), which letters are in the word but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are not in the word at all (gray). The objective is to deduce the hidden word as quickly as possible using logical deduction and pattern recognition.
